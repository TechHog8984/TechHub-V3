# TechHub 

> ## What is TechHub?

TechHub is a script hub I have been working on for a while. 
TechHub originally kickstarted my roblox exploit developing "career". 
The current TechHub is very different than the original versions.

> Where can I find TechHub?

You can find the loadstring to this script [here](script/loadstring.lua)<br>
                      or the short version [here](script/short%20loadstring.lua).
